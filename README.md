# Tetris
This is the Tetris game using the Python library PyGame.

There are a lot of ways to display competence in programming and the one I chose was to create a game. My reasoning for this was to improve my understating of (OOP) object oriented programming. While I have experience with functional programming due to my previous employment, my understanting of OOP was not as extensive.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Install pygame using pip install

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Run main.py in terminal

```bash
python3 main.py
or
python main.py
```
The game should open in a new window and you can start playing.
